## Overview

Infuser is a perpetual trading protocol built on Solana with a built-in deflationary engine.

Every executed trade locks Infuser tokens as fees — permanently removing them from circulation.

No emissions.  
No inflation.  
No farming cycles.  

Just structural scarcity powered by trading activity.

## The Core Mechanism

Each trade:

1. Generates a protocol fee  
2. Fee is denominated in Infuser tokens  
3. Tokens are sent to a permanent lock mechanism  
4. Tokens cannot be accessed, reused, or reintroduced  

As trading volume increases, circulating supply decreases.

Volume → Locking → Scarcity

## Why Infuser?

Traditional perpetual exchanges:
- Inflate token supply
- Depend on emissions
- Reward short-term yield farmers

Infuser:
- Permanently reduces supply
- Aligns usage with token strength
- Converts market activity into deflation

The more traders use the platform, the stronger the scarcity effect.
